This project is a research prototype. 

You can see the design spec [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MiKvyurXvV3CuHyMscl2HKjnl5IhwzXhyOmT9KWGeEk/edit?usp=sharing).

To run the project locally, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to have all the dependencies installed on your machine, then navigate to root directory and run `python3 app.py`.

This project consists of two stages. First, you will go through an onboarding process where ChatGPT will provide you with options to personalize your learning process a little. These options determine what kinds of questions will be chosen to pop up as you watch the video. Then, you will watch a video, and questions will pop up throughout.
